# This code imports a CSV file containing data on Automobile Tire Tread.The
# orginal tibble is altered five times,first to read the csv file ,second to
# impute missing data in UsageMonths with mean,third to normalize the skewed
# distribution using the log method and creating a new column of 
# logUsageMonths,fourth to create a new column with mutate function and using 
# a conditional statement to show treadDepth less than 1.6,and fifth to create
# a data frame so that we can dummy code and divide the position column into 
# four new columns.A scatter plot of Miles and TreadDepth is created and 
# titled as "Tire Miles and Tread Depth Scatter Plot."
